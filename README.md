# Description:

Push Swap is a sorting algorithm written in C that efficiently organises a stack of integers through a set of predefined operations.
The goal of the algorithm is to minimise the number of operations needed to sort the stack ensuring an efficient sorting process.

# Usage:
1. Clone the PUSH_SWAP repo to your local:

	> git clone https://github.com/AyoubLafdili/push_swap.git
 
3. To compile the push_swap program run the following:

   	> make

4. To use it, here is the general syntax:

	> ./push_swap < integer_numbers >

> [!NOTE]
> ***Integers numbers must be***: Non duplicated, In range of type (int)
